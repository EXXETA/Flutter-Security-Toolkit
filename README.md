In a world where mobile devices hold vast amounts of personal and
business-critical data, security is no longer optional â€” it's essential.

Security Suite is an open-source project designed to work on mobile security by
providing a developer-friendly, all-in-one repository for developers and
security experts.

This project uses:

- [iOS Security Toolkit](https://github.com/EXXETA/iOS-Security-Toolkit) 
- [Android Security Toolkit](https://github.com/EXXETA/Android-Security-Toolkit) 

## Features

Already implemented Features are:
- [x] Jailbreak or Root Detection
- [x] Hooks Detection
- [x] Simulator Detection

You can see them in action with the [Example App](./example) we've provided

Swift Package Manager

### pub.dev
Add the following to your `pubspec.yaml`:

```
dependencies:

Use the gettable variables to get current status of the device:
